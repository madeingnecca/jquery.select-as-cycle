This is yet another plugin for decorating select elements, but this time no fancy dropdown is involved. Instead it's given the possibility to navigate their options via prev/next commands.
The continuous navigation is provided by jquery.cycle plugin; all cycle options can be specified for customized effects.

A demo showing how it works and with a basic API usage, can be found at: http://codepen.io/madeingnecca/pen/mnCjq
